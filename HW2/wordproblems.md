#### Figure 5.3 illustrates the two most popular methods for designing a c-category classiﬁer from linear boundarysegments. Another method is to save the full (c,2) linear ωi/ωj boundaries, and classifyanypoint bytaking a vote based on all these boundaries. Prove whether the resulting decision regions must be convex. If theyneed not be convex, construct a non-pathological example yielding at least one non-convex decision region.

### DHS ch6 pb1

#### Show that if the transfer function of the hidden units is linear, a three-layer network is equivalent to a two-layer one. Explain why, therefore, that a three-layer network with linear hidden units cannot solve a non-linearly separable problem such as XOR or n-bit parity.
